Ansible Script : setup.yml

Note:: I have used a workaround to modify the Vagrantfile in the remote machine when vagrant is automatically configured using ansible. I have created a sample Vagrantfile which I would copy into remote location. For that I need to keep my vagrantfile in source. Hence please keep the Vagrantfile in the repository on the same location where the ansible script will be running.
